Comparable store sales includes revenues from stores that were temporarily closed during the period as a result of COVID-19. Comparable store sales represents a performance metric that we believe is useful information for management and investors in understanding the performance of our established NIKE-owned in-line and factory stores. Management considers this metric when making financial and operating decisions. The method of calculating comparable store sales varies across the retail industry. As a result, our calculation of this metric may not be comparable to similarly titled metrics used by other companies.\\n\\n2023 FORM 10-K 30\\n\\nTable of Contents\\n\\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\\n\\n(Dollars in millions, except per share data)\\n\\nRevenues Cost of sales\\n\\nGross profit Gross margin\\n\\nDemand creation expense Operating overhead expense\\n\\nTotal selling and administrative expense % of revenues\\n\\nInterest expense (income), net\\n\\nOther (income) expense, net Income before income taxes\\n\\nIncome tax expense Effective tax rate\\n\\nNET INCOME Diluted earnings per common share\\n\\n$\\n\\n$ $'},\n",

These trends are affecting many global manufacturing and service sectors, and the footwear and apparel industries, as a whole, are not immune. Companies in our industry are facing trade protectionism in many different regions, and, in nearly all cases, we are working together with industry groups to address trade issues and reduce the impact to the industry, while observing applicable competition laws. Notwithstanding our efforts, protectionist measures have resulted in increases in the cost of our products, and additional measures, if implemented, could adversely affect sales and/or profitability for NIKE, as well as the imported footwear and apparel industry as a whole.'}]"
